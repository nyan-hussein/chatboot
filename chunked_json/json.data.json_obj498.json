Fusarium was first discovered in 1958, and while notorious for causing the devastating disease it causes in plants and crops, it is now recognized as an emerging global opportunistic human pathogen causing numerous cases of fusariosis"

While roughly 80% of the human cases of fusariosis are caused by members of the Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani species complexes, there are many infections attributed to the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex. Here, we report the draft whole-genome sequence of F. fujikuroi strain COH1152, which was isolated from a 68-year-old male with refractory acute myeloid leukemia."
