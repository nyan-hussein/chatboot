As part of our studies on long-term genetic changes in drinking water biofilm species, we report the draft genome sequence of Sphingomonas strain Sph5, isolated from a tap water filtration membrane. The isolate was determined as Sphingomonas paucimobilis through whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly.

Here, we report the genome sequence of a prevalent isolate. Sphingomonas spp. Sph5 was isolated from a biofilm on a Nadir MP005 microfiltration membrane used for drinking water biofouling studies (1, 5). Sph5 was previously reported to be phylogenetically closest to Sphingomonas sanguinis strains BAB-7166 (99%) and NBRC 13937 (99%) based on 16S rRNA sequencing and"
