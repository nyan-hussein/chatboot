The Fusarium oxysporum species complex represents one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide, causing disease in many economically important plants and crops (1), but can also cause opportunistic infections in humans (2, 3). However, F. oxysporum, like other fungi, produces many bioactive compounds that are beneficial to"

During the course of the “Veggie” project (a vegetable production system flown onboard the International Space Station [ISS] to study the effects of the space environment on plant growth and function), Zinnia hybrida plants became afflicted with a foliar, stem, and root rot disease caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum. Isolates were cultured from the leaf (VEG-01C1) and the root (VEG-01C2)"

Both methods showed that VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2 were most closely related to F. oxysporum IMV-00293, an isolate cultured in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster (GenBank assembly accession number GCA_001931975).

Interestingly, F. oxysporum strains VEG-01C1, VEG-01C2, and IMV-00293 (i.e., the Chernobyl strain) were very similar to the clinical F. oxysporum strain FOSC 3-a (GenBank assembly accession number GCA_000271745), an isolate cultured from blood from a patient in the United States suffering from fusariosis. Comparative genomics of these Z. hybrida leaf and root fungal strains with the Chernobyl (IMV-00293) strain could provide insight into which genes could allow for growth in extreme environments, such"
