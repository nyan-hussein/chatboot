Members of this group are ubiquitous in nature, found in soil, sediments, air, freshwater, marine ecosystems, and foods and in extreme environments with high temperatures (1). Bacillaceae groups are reported to produce a wide range of valuable and thermostable extracellular enzymes (2). The majority of Bacillaceae can form endospores that are crucial for survival in harsh environments (3, 4). This spore-forming property makes it important for NASA planetary protection purposes because spore-forming bacteria are more likely to survive sterilization"

The samples were collected using premoistened polyester wipes (6), brought back to Earth, aseptically transferred to a 500-ml bottle containing 200 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, mixed by vigorously shaking, and concentrated via a filtration system.

A single colony from each incubated plate was used for genomic DNA extraction using the ZymoBIOMICS MagBead DNA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Zymo Research, USA). All isolates were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing based on similarity to their type strain 16S rRNA, as previously reported (6). To create the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of these strains, shotgun libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera Flex protocol (7),"

Quality control for adapter trimming and quality filtering were performed using fastp v0.20.0 (9), and then SPAdes v3.11.1 (10) was used to assemble all the cleaned sequences. Fastp quality control was based on the following three parameters: (i) correction of mismatches in overlapped regions of paired-end reads, (ii) trimming of autodetected adapter sequences, and (iii) quality trimming at the 5′"
