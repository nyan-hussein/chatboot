This class comprises yeasts, dimorphic fungi, and organisms that form hyphae or complex fruiting bodies (2). In this class, the genera Naganishia and Papiliotrema were amended to accommodate the Cryptococcus albidus clade and a few other Cryptococcus species, respectively (3). Among the Cryptococcus species, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are the most common human pathogens; however, recently, there has been an increase in infections caused by non-neoformans Cryptococcus species (4–8). This report presents the draft genome assemblies of four such non-neoformans"

In this study, the draft genome sequences of six strains belonging to the class Tremellomycetes isolated from the ISS were determined (1). Descriptions of the sample collection, processing, and presumptive identification of these isolates were published elsewhere (1). Briefly, samples collected from the ISS were processed, and 100 μl of each dilution was plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) with 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The plates were incubated at 25°C for 7"

Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out using a ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit (Lysis tubes) (Zymo Research, USA) after bead beating using a Bertin Precellys homogenizer. This was followed by library preparation using the Illumina Nextera Flex protocol as per Illumina document number 1000000025416 v07.
