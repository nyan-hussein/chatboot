The Penicillium genus encompasses more than 350 species found worldwide in soil, vegetation, air, indoor environments, and food (2). Aspergillus species are saprophytes found in a variety of environmental niches; however, some of them are also opportunistic human pathogens (3, 4). Members of the Penicillium and Aspergillus genera are of economic and industrial importance, including Penicillium chrysogenum, which is used to produce β-lactam antibiotics (5), Penicillium camemberti, which is used for maturation of soft cheeses such as Camembert, Brie, and Neufchatel"

Recently, Penicillium polonicum has been shown to tolerate and effectively remove lead (Pb) from polluted water, indicating a promising solution for new remediation strategies to purify contaminated water (9). Lastly, Aspergillus unguis, Penicillium dipodomyicola, and Penicillium griseoroseum have been reported to produce novel bioactive compounds (10–13). Considering existing and yet-to-be uncovered, versatile applications of Penicillium and Aspergillus species, characterization of WGS of these fungi is critical. Additionally, since fungi are excellent models for studying evolution and adaptation, due to their experimental features (14), the ISS-isolated species are of unique significance for"

The procedure for collecting samples and performing consecutive processing steps has been described elsewhere (1). Briefly, surface samples were collected with premoistened polyester wipes and then resuspended in 200 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with vigorous shaking. The extracted samples were concentrated using InnovaPrep (Drexel, MO) CP-150 concentrating pipettes. Aliquots (100 μl) of each sample were plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) containing 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol and incubated at 25°C for 7 days. A single colony was picked, restreaked onto PDA, and incubated at 25°C for 7 days. About 1 μg"

The quality of the raw reads obtained was confirmed with FastQC (v0.11.7) (16). Assessment of the quality filtering steps and adapter removal were performed using fastp (v0.20.0) (17).
