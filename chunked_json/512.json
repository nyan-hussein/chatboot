These baseline sequences will help to understand the observed production of novel bioactive compounds. In a screening project of natural products, fungal strains isolated from environments associated with the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP) accident (1) have been investigated.

Aspergillus niger, an industrially important filamentous fungus, contains a sequence resembling the fumonisin gene cluster, which suggests that the fungus has the genetic potential to produce carcinogenic fumonisins (2). A. niger also produces an abundance of naphtho-gamma-pyrone secondary metabolites, which have been shown to have antibacterial, antifungal (3), antitumor (4), and cytotoxic (3, 4)"

One of the most important secondary metabolites made by A. terreus is the cholesterol-lowering molecule lovastatin. Discovery of this potent compound revolutionized the treatment of hypercholesterolemia (8, 9). Aureobasidium pullulans is an important producer of pullulan, a homopolysaccharide of glucose that is widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, and electronics industries (10, 11)."

Beauveria bassiana is an entomopathogenic fungus used to produce biodegradable, nonpoisonous, and cost-efficient bioinsecticides (13). Genomic analysis of B. bassiana exhibits its capacity to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites, such as oosporein, bassianin, beauvericin, or oxalic acid (14).
