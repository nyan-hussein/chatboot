    "text": "In this article we report the identification of T-DNA (transfer DNA) insertion sites within two different gene regions in the genome of an Arabidopsis mutant line, SALK_084889. The T-DNA positions are in the 3′ UTR (untranslated region) of DREB2A (Dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2A) (AT5G05410) and promoter of LOX1 (Lipoxygenase 1) (AT1G55020) as determined by DNA-PCR and sanger sequencing. The expression levels of DREB2A and LOX1 were also analyzed using quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) in SALK_084889 and wild type Arabidopsis (Col, Columbia). Further, the comparison of drought and heat tolerance between Col and SALK_084889 were conducted by stress treatments. The present data indicate that in SALK_084889, the expression of DREB2A is not downregulated under normal growth conditions but can"
